        <h3 class="lasagne">What is Lasagne?</h3>

        <p>A rich and creamy whole-wheat pasta dish filled layer by layer with refreshingly fresh onions and garlic, lathered in a succulent sauce and topped with imported, premium quality mozzarella.</p>

        <h4 class="lasagne">Ingredients</h4>
        <p>
            <ul>
               <li>250g beef mince</li>
                <li>400g tin chopped tomatoes</li>
                <li>9-12 lasagne sheets</li>
                <li>50g grated parmesan</li>
                <li>200ml beef stock</li>
                <li>200ml red wine</li>
                <li>150g shredded mozzarella</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>In a large pan, heat the olive oil over a low heat. Fry the onion, carrot, celery and garlic for 5 mins, or until softened. Add the mince and fry on a medium heat until golden. Turn up the heat, pour in the wine and bubble until reduced. Stir in the tomato purée, chopped tomatoes and stock. Add in the Worcestershire sauce and simmer for 15 mins, or until the liquid has reduced. Season.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make the white sauce. Melt the butter in a small saucepan over a low heat and add the flour. Whisk until combined and cook on low for 1-2 mins. Remove from the heat and gradually whisk in the milk until you have a loose sauce. Season. Return to a gentle heat and whisk constantly until the sauce thickens.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to gas 6, 200°C, fan 180°C. Layer up the lasagne in a baking dish, starting with a third each of the ragu, then the pasta, then the white sauce. Repeat twice. Top with the Parmesan and mozzarella then bake in the oven for 40-45 mins, until piping hot and crisp and bubbling on top. Serve immediately.</li>
